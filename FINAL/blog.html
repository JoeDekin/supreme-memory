            <div class="blogpost"><div class="box"><h1>I'd Rather Have Cancer</h1><h3>Tony Gowland</h3> <p>I’d like to start by asking you a question – have you ever heard anyone utter the phrase: “I’d rather have cancer?”
                    The chances are that you haven’t, and yet amongst sufferers of IPF the sentiment is not uncommon. I think there are two reasons for this. The first is based on a brutal fact – people are increasingly cured of cancer, yet no-one has ever been cured of IPF.</p>
                <p>The second is a little more subtle. Bear with me here. Clearly I know nothing of your background or personal circumstances but I’ll assume you remember puberty and the ensuing emotional roller-coaster that was your adolescence? It was a time of realising there were things happening inside that you didn’t understand followed by a burning need to form some kind of identity, to be popular, attractive and dare I say; normal? You will have been accepted by some kids and rejected by others as you stepped awkwardly into the baffling world of being a fledgling grown-up. Or was that just me? </p>
                <p>I mention this only because those feelings of uncertainty and rejection came flooding back to me a while ago as I was walking through the new Bexley Cancer Wing at St. James’ Hospital in Leeds. It is truly wonderful – fresh, huge open spaces displaying artworks in a calm serine atmosphere not dissimilar to a classy hotel foyer or an upmarket shopping mall. But this ‘shopping mall’ has a very ‘special offer’, one that most visitors simply take for granted, one that is emblazoned on the walls and embedded in the very core of the building and the staff, yet one that is not afforded to the likes of me.</p></div>
            </div>
                <div class="blogpost"><div class="box"><h1>My Journey So Far</h1><h3>Tony Gowland</h3> <p>I want to give you some context to show where I started with this disease and roughly how I arrived at where I am today. This is an insight into the milestones I’ve faced to date.</p>
                    <p>It was late 2011 when I noticed I was coughing more than normal. I was cycling to work and back, reasonably fit on an excellent diet with the perfect body mass index; what could possibly go wrong?</p>
                    <p>aI started going to my GP with suspected chest infections and was given a variety of antibiotics over the next few months. Nothing changed and an equally inconclusive chest x-ray was followed by a CT scan, then in May 2012 I was introduced to the three letters that would come to occupy my every waking thought; IPF. </p>
                    <p>Once I got used to the idea, and it took a while, I realised I was potentially quite fortunate in that my diagnosis was made before I had experienced breathlessness. For the majority it seems that isn’t the case. I was pretty much symptom free for the next year or so, although a shortness of breath was creeping in quietly.</p></div> </div> 
                    <div class="blogpost"><div class="box"><h1>The Good Bits</h1><h3>Tony Gowland</h3> <p>I’ve heard myself say some fairly strange stuff over the years, but I was rather taken by a line I uttered shortly after diagnosis, sat in the pub with my brothers: “Whatever is coming, I’m determined to find a way of enjoying it.” The chances are I wasn’t on my first pint.
                    </p>
                        <p>I was holding things together quite well that day and noted that the line struck an impressive chord. The fact that I hadn’t the faintest idea how I might enjoy anything in the future made those words sound sadly hollow to me, rather good acting, playing to the crowds who were under the utterly false impression I was on top of things.
                            </p>
                        <p>aWhat I learned over the next few years were life lessons that took me from floundering around feeling sorry for myself, to coming to terms with my situation and being able to develop a mind-set that allows me to recognise what’s truly important. And yes, for the record, I’m happy, but that doesn’t mean I’m immune to bad days, far from it.</p>
                        <p>Most of us have been around the block enough times to know that writing or reading one article isn’t going to change our world. We also know that there are times when we need something to help nudge us out of a certain frame of mind that we’ve become a little too attached to. I was faced with having a seriously reduced lifespan and then having to spend what ever time I had left feeling depressed. I had no say in the IPF but I was damned if I’d give in to the depression. My head was full of miserable stuff, so I started by slowly replacing it with something more uplifting.</p></div>

                        <div class="blogpost"><div class="box"><h1>Fight Club</h1><h3>Sandra Rock</h3> <p>I had surgery and I had been on IV antibiotics for 15 months. Once I got off the antibiotics, within a couple of weeks, I started getting short of breath, and it just got worse and worse. By the time I finally got to see a doctor, I couldn’t walk across the room without being short of breath.</p>
                            <p>
                                    I saw my primary care doctor and she took an X-ray and said, “You need to see a pulmonologist,” so she connected me with one here in Sacramento. I had a CT scan done, and at that point I had lost 50 percent capacity in both my lungs from the inflammation.</p>
                            <p>Back then, in 2001, when I was diagnosed, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) had just been recently classified as its own disease, so there wasn’t a lot out there about what to do.</p>
                            <p>As I tried to find out more about IPF, I got in touch with the Coalition for Pulmonary Fibrosis and I started a support group for patients and caregivers.</p></div>
