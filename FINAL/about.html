<h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
<p>Founded in 2000 by brothers Albert Rose and Michael Rosenzweig, PhD, the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to identifying effective PF treatments and assisting those living with the disease. The brothers experienced firsthand the devastating effects of PF when their sister Claire passed away from the disease.  Both brothers were also diagnosed with PF, and it was their vision and dedication that led to the creation of the Foundation.</p>
