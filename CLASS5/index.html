<h3>O</h3>h, let the sun beat down upon my face
Stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of a gentle race
This world is seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
But, all will be revealed</p></div>
  <div class="column"><p><h3>T</h3>alk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
Though, by a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Whoa-hoh, whoa-oh, yeah
Yes, yes
Oooh, oh baby, baby, I been cryin'
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh, there's no denyin', there's no denyin'
Oooh yes, baby baby, I've been flyin', oh yeah</p></div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
  <div class="column"><p><h3>L</h3>ord, mama, ain't no denyin', no denyin', no denyin'
Here's another one to ya
All I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Tryin' to find now, where I been, yeah
Pilot of the storm who leaves no trace</p></div>
  <div class="column"><p><h3>L</h3>ike thoughts inside a dream
Who heed the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert screen
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir
